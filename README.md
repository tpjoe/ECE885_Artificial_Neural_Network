# ECE885_Artificial_Neural_Network

This repository contains projects for my ECE885 course: Artificial Neural Network
These projects include (up to 15th Jan 2018):

1. Classification of handwritten digit number (MNIST dataset)
2. Midification of neural network's learning rate and its performance

The conclusion and findings from these two projects are written in the MNIST data one.
